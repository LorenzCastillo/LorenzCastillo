## **`Seeking to be a Software / Web Developer`**

My name is Lorenz Castillo and I am a student at Vancouver Community College taking the Computer Systems Technology Program with 2 years of experience in web app development and design hoping one day to become a Full-Stack Developer. I know not only how to code but also edit videos using Adobe Premiere and edit Photos using Adobe Photoshop as a hobby.
